EC2- |
------
 - Elastic compute cloude.
 - Used to create instances which are VM wares. 
 - EC2 is a regional service. 
-> Use EC2 global view on top of EC2 homepage for a detailed view of all your resources in all the regions. [vpc, endponts, instance, SG etc]
-> In one region and under one VPC we can lunch 1000 ec2. More than that will charge you heavly. This is a softlimit from amazon.

 General-Purpose Instances
 Compute-Optimized Instances
 Memory-Optimized Instances
 Storage Optimized Instances
 Accelerated Computing Instances

-> In order to create EC2 instance VPC with atleast one subnet is mandatory.
 - Must have permission for the user to create instances
 - By giving the private IP of a client instance inside of a public instance we dont have to worry about the public IP getting chnaged and will have specific access.
 - By creating an instance inside a public subnet, we can use it as jump server. [jump server - use this to connect to other instances inside the private servers inside that VPC]
-> If we have missed assigning a Public Ip while creating the Instance we can use a Elastic Ip afterwards for the connection.
 - Elastic Ip is chargable so delete it after the use.
-> After you change the password of your user and enable "passwordless authetication = yes" then you can login to you accont without private keypair.
-> To login using password ---> ssh ec2-user@<public_IP> ---> give user password when asked.
-> To change the instance type of a running server -- we have to first stop the server --> which leads to downtime ---> requires approval from the owner
- Depending upon how many IPs the subnet have you can only lunch that much instance under that subnet. 
- RDP(3389)----> for windows, ssh(22)----> for Linux
- RDP pre installed in windows and mobaxtream or putty for linux

--------
KeyPair:
--------
-> When we try to ssh within a instance make sure the key_pair file has right permissions ---> ls -la ----> chmod 400 <key_pair.pem>
-> Key_pair file should alz have read only permission.    r-- --- --- >> 400 000 000 >>> r = 4, w = 2, x = 1
-> Key pair is a encrypted file where our password is stored and we use this along with the username to login.
-> Keyparir is a regional and can only be used only the created region only.
- We can delete existing keypairs by going to ec2 ---> keypair ---> choose keypair ---> delete
 


--------------------
Security Groups[SG] :
--------------------
- SG works as a instance level gatekeeper.
- It checks the inbound and outbound traffic as specified inside it.
- After creating an instance alz check the SG or choose the SG with the right permissions.

---------------
IP of instance:
---------------
Private IP - Used for internal communication. 
		   - This IP will be coming form our subnet CIDR range excluding first 4 and last1 IP.
	       - Does not charge any money

Public IP  - For External communication.
	       - This IP comes from the Amazon open IP pool.
	       - This IP will change when you stop the EC2 instance. Change means it will be released and a new IP will be allocated to you instance. 
          -> public IP will not change when you restart the instance.
	       - Does not cost any money

Elastic IP - This IP also used for External communication.
		   - This IP also comes from the Amazon open IP pool.
	       - This IP is permanet will be allocated to your resource if you choose to attach one.
	       - It will not change when ever you restart or stop your instance.
	       - Costs money only if the IP is ideal. If it is attached to a running resource then it will be free.
          -> If the attached resource is stoped and the EIP is ideal then it will start charing money.


----------------------
EC2-LAB-WINDOWS/LINUX:
----------------------
 - To log into you windows lab first make sure to enable RDP port inside the SG.
 - To get the username and password ---> connect ----> RDP client ----> get password ---> upload the private keypair and decrypt. 
 - User name should be administrator and password will be given after decryption.
 - Type Remote Desktop Protocol in windows and give the credentials.


>> For Linux password login instead of keyparir:
------------------------------------------------
 - Log in to the instance and go to root user and change the ec2-user password
 - sudo su ---> ec2-user passwd ---> give new password
 - got to /etc/ssh/sshd_config ---> Enable passwordAuthentication yes
 - sudo systemctl restart sshd
 - Go to console --> ssh ec2-user@<ip> ---> password when asked
-> TO give user full access type ---> visudo, under root ---> <username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
   CTRL + O ---> Enter ----> CTRL + X


>> Changing windows password after login and adding user:
---------------------------------------------------------
 - Log into the windows instance ---> RDP ---> username and password from EC2 console
 - Go to computer management ----> Local user and groups ----> Users ---> Choose user name like "Administrator" ---> right click and set password
 - Login again using RDP but this time use the new password
 - To add one more user ---> right click on users and add new.
 - Go to groups ---> choose the group and give the new user name and search it ---> Apply then ok so that the new user is added to the group
 

------------------------------------
Cross EC2 access public to private  |
------------------------------------
- If our ec2 or other resources are inside a private subnet we cant directly connect to the using internet.
- To connect to out private resoueces we have multiple methods: 
	- Direct connect ----> Only for huge amount of data migration from onpremises to cloud. 
	- Jump Server or bastion host [here one instace will be in public subnet and inside thise we will be able to access other private resoueces in that VPC]
	- VPN [ex. OpenVPN - This will cost money] ---> ex. OpenVPN in marketplace AMI.

---------
VPN Lab	|
---------
- To use VPN for EC2 login we will use marketplace VPN called oepnvpn ----> openvpnas [username - mobaxterm]
-> We will always install the vpn inside the public instance. 
- Once vpn is installed we have to install the client VPN inside our laptop. 
- When creating an instance from Marketplace AMI, it will automatically create a SG with all the ports required for instace.
- When asked for the option always choose privateIP while configuring the instace. 
- Algorithm --- RSA 
- Setup so that traffice should be allowed to public VPN even though VPN is not enabled but [without VPN only access public subnet]
- Private server access should only be allowed within vpn. 
- Setup password for VPN when asked. 
- After setup you will be given Admin and client UI urls. Go to admin ui url to see all the users and status. [User name - OpenVPN]
- Go to client UI url to download the VPN software.  [username - openvpn]
- Once VPN is active you can access to the private resources through mobaxterm or other things.


------------------
Placement Groups |
------------------
- When creating multiple instace or resoueces they might be created in different AZs. And some latency might occure.
- To solve this issue AWS has given a service called Placement Groups.
- It allows us to keep all the servers in one place.

TYPES: 
	- Cluster : All servers are with in a single AZ and created under one hardware
	
	- Partition : One AZ but the hardware may be different
	
	- Spread: One AZ but all the servers are in different hardware
