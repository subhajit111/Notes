ASG - Auto Scaling Group

 - ASG is not chargeable. 
 - Dont manually change anything in ec2 coz once ASG is up it will handle it. 
 - This is used to balane the servers required in order to maintain the demand.
 - It can automatically scale up and down the servers based on the upcoming requests.
 - Like terraform ASG also has the current and desired state options. 
 - If the desired state of instance is maintained then there will be no downtime. 

Benifits - Business As Usual [BAU]
		 - Cost Optimization
		 - Disaster recovery 
		 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Horizental Scaling - When we are upgrading on the same sever like keep on increasing its ram or storage. 
				   - There will be a downtime. 
				   
Vertical Scaling   - When we are addin more servers 
				   - There will be no downtime.

Differnce bet AMI and Lunch template ?
	AMI - Can be used directly to create the instances
		- cant be versioned 
		
	LT  - Will be used by ASG to indirectly create the instances
		- We can version it.

LUNCH TEMPLATE |
----------------
- Lunch Template -> Collection of Configuration items, application details etc. [OS, application conf, DB conf, SG, EBS etc.]

Creation :
---------
- Go to ec2 and go to lunch template and create LT.
- Give LT name and version name
- We can specify tags if needed and can copy form a source template as well.
- Setup rest as Ec2 
- We can setup a lot of things in advanced details including user data.

Creating ASG : 
------------- 
- Go to ASG and create
- Choose your template and go next
- Choose your VPC and choose all the subnets and go next
- We have an option to integrate with LB [we will do that later]
- Health chech we can set as 30
- Gour size --> min , desired and max can be set up to our requirement. [ex. 1,2,3]
- We can also choose instance maintenance policy as per our requirement
- We can also setup notification as SNS which will notify us as the ASG makes changes. 
- Go next and create ASG

- We can check the activities of our ASG inside ASG activities
- In ec2 instance make sure instance lifecycle is inservice. 
- We can edit the group details inside ASG to change the min, max and desired state and it will automatically changes the instances. 
- Even if we delete a server manually, ASG will automatically create new servers to match the desired state. 
- We can also keep min and desired as 0 


------------------------
ASG with Load Balancer |
------------------------
- While creating the ASG in the load balancer page we can choose to either create or attach existing LB.
- To create new LB just choose attach new LB ---> Type of LB 
- Make sure it is internet facing
- Create a new target group or click on existing if you have anything
